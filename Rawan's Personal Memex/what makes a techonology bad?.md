With how assecible it is to own a smartphone and social media or constantly depending on techonolgy to accomplish tasks, social media has taken over people's daily lives. Studies have shown that "Gen Z, individuals born after mid-1990s, are significantly more depressed, anxious, and fragile than previous generations due to their heavy use of social media while growing up". It has also been noted that tech companies "addiction- and manipulation-based technology environment where tech companies use psychology and artificial intelligence (AI) to exploit human vulnerabilities for profit maximization".  In these scenarios technology isnt made with the intention of benefitting societies and i more concerned with making profit.
