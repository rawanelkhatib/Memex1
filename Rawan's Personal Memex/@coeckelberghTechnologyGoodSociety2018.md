### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article takes a much more philosophical approach to technology and the good society. It is concerned with the ethics of technology and how usually they are studied in relation to the individual. Mark Coeckelbergh argues that it would be a lot more helpful to use political philosophy as an approach to learning about technology and its effects. This view provides a broader perspective of the effects of technology and relates it on a societal level rather than to the individual.
