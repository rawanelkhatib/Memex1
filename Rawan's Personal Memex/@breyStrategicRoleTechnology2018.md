### Summary & Key Take Aways

Philip Brey discusses the positive and negative social impacts of technology and defines criteria by which we can evaluate it. In this article, he explains the most common intrinsic and instrumental values that are necessary for societies to function and explains how to design technologies to better support them. Brey notes that technology influences the way people behave individually, and with others, and as whole institutions and cultures. These influences, according to Brey, are built on affordances and constraints. From his point of view, technology is good when it gives affordances to people to promote their values and does not constraint use against any kind of person.
