### Idea note

Well-being and justice and universally considered good values to have within a community and according to Brey they are the two most important intrinsic values for a community. So for a technology to be good it must promote these ideals. People differ in what they view important, is it rational to assume that well-being and justice could be the one way that technology can be design to influence society to do good?
