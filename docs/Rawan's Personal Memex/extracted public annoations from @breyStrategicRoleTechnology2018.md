As a consequence, the introduction of a new technological product will affect potential users in different ways, benefiting some while excluding or marginalizing others.[^1]

> Similarly, technological products may foster new cultural forms and systems. They have enabled new subcultures that center on technology use or are enabled by it, and they may change cultural values, attitudes and practices by the affordances they generate. For example, birth control pills have arguably aided in the sexual liberation of women and thereby supported a more equal status for women and men.[^1]
