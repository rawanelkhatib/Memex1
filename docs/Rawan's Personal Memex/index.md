### The Main Lens
As a computer science major, most of the work I do invloves building technologies. When you first get started with this degree they teach you the history of coding (and encoding) and then teach you how to create many differnt kinds of projects and softwares. One of the most important skills you learn is adaptability. Techonolgy being an evergrowing fast-paced field, things change everyday and thus you must be able to adapt to those changes as well. This skill is harder to implement in a larger scale and has more ramifications. You'll hear people talk about how resistent boomers are to new technologies or how mellienals are stuck in the Facebook era or how Gen Z kids can't get through their meals without their Ipads. Technology effects people in different ways and through my degree i haven't been able to fully grasp how the work I'm doing now will have an effect on society. What will change? What will be good? What will be bad? Is techonolgy to blame for these effects or is society? This is the perspective that I'm using going into this research.
