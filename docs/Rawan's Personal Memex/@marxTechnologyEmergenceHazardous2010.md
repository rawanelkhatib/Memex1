### Summary & Key Take Aways

Leo Marx splits technology into two types: ideological and substantive. The ideological approach views technology as a mean to an end, "only as the means of achieving progress." The substantive approach sees technology as something that is influenced and changed by society. He believes that technology does not form us, instead we form it. He see techonolgy as an "all-purpose agency of change", and less as this active creature that has its own "hazerdous character".
