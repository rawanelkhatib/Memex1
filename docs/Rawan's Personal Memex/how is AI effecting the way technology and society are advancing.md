### Idea note

AI has been an emerging technology for the past several years. It is a very powerful technology that is supposed to simulate human intellagence using machines and comoputer systems. It has been taking over functions in the workplace and leading to higher levels of unemplyment. It has had distruptive effects on communities and can also discriminate against marganalized groups. "There are concerns that AI will make human race enfeebled, alienated, obsolescent, or subjugated."
